# Elevator Dashboard

This repository contains the code for a Elevator Dashboard. The system consists of two main components: a frontend single-page application built with ReactJS and a backend API implemented using ExpressJS. The system uses MongoDB to store elevator data. We have also included tests for backend, along with documentation on the API endpoints, frontend components, and the database schema.
